          *How to Train Your Dragon* was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, known for their work on *Lilo & Stitch*. The film is based loosely on the book series by Cressida Cowell, though the story and characters were heavily reimagined to create a more cinematic and emotionally impactful experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The movie was produced by DreamWorks Animation and released in March 2010. It quickly gained critical acclaim for its storytelling, visuals, and musical score.

        <p>
          The animation team pushed boundaries to create stunning flight scenes and emotional expressions, especially for Toothless, who doesn‚Äôt speak. Animators drew inspiration from cats, dogs, birds, and reptiles to make the dragons feel grounded in real animal behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cinematographer Roger Deakins, known for his work on *Skyfall* and *Blade Runner 2049*, was brought in to help advise on lighting and camera movement, giving the film a more cinematic look than most animated movies at the time.
