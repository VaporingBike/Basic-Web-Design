        <h2>üåä Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In the Viking village of Berk, dragons are a constant threat, raiding livestock and burning homes. Every Viking is trained to fight them ‚Äî every Viking except Hiccup, a scrawny teen with a mind full of ideas and inventions. Desperate to prove himself, Hiccup injures a dragon with one of his gadgets. But when he finds it in the forest, he can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, he sets it free.
