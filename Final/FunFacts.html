        <h2>üéâ Movie Trivia</h2>
        <img class="movie_post" src="images/bookless.jpg" alt="Book Toothless">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Based on a book:</strong> The film is loosely adapted from Cressida Cowell‚Äôs book *How to Train Your Dragon*, but the plot and tone were changed significantly for the screen.</li>
          <li><strong>Toothless wasn‚Äôt always cool:</strong> In the original book, Toothless is a small, stubborn Common or Garden Dragon ‚Äî not a Night Fury.</li>
          <li><strong>Toothless's personality:</strong> Animators modeled his expressions and behaviors on cats, dogs, and even horses to make him emotionally expressive and endearing.</li>
          <li><strong>Silent star:</strong> Toothless doesn‚Äôt talk, but his vocalizations are a blend of animal sounds ‚Äî cats, elephants, tigers, and even dolphins.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice actor twist:</strong> Most of the young characters have American accents, while the adults have Scottish accents ‚Äî a deliberate choice to emphasize the generational gap.</li>

          <li>Gobber casually mentions "monstrous nightmares and zipplebacks" in his dragon lessons ‚Äî direct references to the dragons we later see the teens ride.</li>
          <li>Some of the sounds in the dragon training arena were **recycled** from other DreamWorks films like *Shrek* and *Kung Fu Panda*.</li>
