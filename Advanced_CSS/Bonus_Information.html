                    <li><strong>Research Inspiration:</strong> The film's creators spent time studying real-life animals and their movements to accurately depict the dragons in flight. For instance, the way Toothless moves is influenced by the agile nature of felines.</li>

            <h3 class="Heading_style">Inspirations for the world of Berk</h3>
                <p>
                    The island of Berk was designed with inspiration from the Nordic landscapes. The team visited Norway to get a sense of the environment, incorporating fjords, rocky mountains, and lush greenery into the world. They used these natural features to create a Viking world that felt authentic but still magical enough for dragons to exist.
